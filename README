AskQ, a structured keyword search extension for Semantic MediaWiki
Author: Michael White <m@mwhite.info>

This is a fork/clone of the SVN repo for AskQ.  I don't plan on further developing AskQ, but I want the code to be more accessible.

For documentation, see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AskQ.
